# yulu_case_study
Yulu is a shared micro-mobility company that provides electric bikes and scooters for rent in India. The company has been very successful, but it is facing some challenges. 

These challenges include:  
Competition from other shared micro-mobility companies
- Competition from other shared micro-mobility companies: There are a number of other shared micro-mobility companies operating in India, and this is putting pressure on Yulu's market share.
- Regulations: The Indian government is considering regulations that could make it more difficult for shared micro-mobility companies to operate.
- Weather: The Indian weather can be unpredictable, and this can impact the demand for Yulu's services.

## Insights: The insights that I derived from my analysis of the Yulu Bike Sharing business problem are as follows:
- In summer and fall seasons more bikes are rented as compared to other seasons.
- Whenever its a holiday more bikes are rented.
- It is also clear from the workingday also that whenever day is holiday or weekend, slightly
more bikes were rented.
- Whenever there is rain, thunderstorm, snow or fog, there were less bikes were rented.
- Whenever the humidity is less than 20, number of bikes rented is very very low.
- Whenever the temperature is less than 10, number of bikes rented is less.
- Whenever the windspeed is greater than 35, number of bikes rented is less.

## Recommendations: Based on my insights, I recommend that Yulu Bike Sharing focus on the following areas:

-  In summer and fall seasons the company should have more bikes in stock to be rented.
Because the demand in these seasons is higher as compared to other seasons.
- With a significance level of 0.05, workingday has no effect on the number of bikes being
rented.
- In very low humid days, company should have less bikes in the stock to be rented.
- Whenever temprature is less than 10 or in very cold days, company should have less bikes.
- Whenever the windspeed is greater than 35 or in thunderstorms, company should have less
bikes in stock to be rented
